# LSSVM
Least Squares Support Vector Machine projects

In an attempt to learn hands-on what machine learning really entails, I have started to look
at the LSSVM method of Machine Learning. And so I created this repository to keep track of my
learning process, and to be able to backtrack this "step-wise" process. Though reading about 
it in papers and online, I lacked a proper example that could introduce me to LSSVM. That is
when I came across this repository (https://github.com/shiluqiang/WLSSVM_python), which I used
as a basis for my first example.
